# Useful Quickstart Project

*Develop with Useful, a frameworkless framework using PSR compliant components.*

The Useful Quickstart Project provides a base PHP project that uses PSR compliant components.

The main goal of the project is to promote modern best practices in the form of an easy to use, lightweight,
modular, unopinionated, frameworkless project template. 

# Getting Started
The Useful Quickstart project includes an installer, which can be used to select from a range of PSR compliant packages 
to pre-install.

Start a new Useful project with Composer:
```bash
$ composer create-project useful/project
```
Then follow the on-screen instructions. It's that easy!
